# Travel algorithm
This algorithm can be used for patients that travel to other countries and need to use their medicines frequently.
We made an algorithm that calculates when you need to use a specific medicine based on a few attributes.
We call, moments you need to take your medicine, intakes.

# Our algirthms
We've made two implementations that can be used:
- Smart algortihm
- Brute algorithm

All algorithms do the same. All calculate new intakes based on, what we call, a algorithm context, which results into a scheme. But each algorithm does this in its own way, on a different level and from a difference perspective.

The idea of multiple algorithms is that the patient can choose which scheme suits him the most. Thus making this user friendly and very flexible.
